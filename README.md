# Regrets & Complaints

**Regrets & Complaints** is my third participation in a game jam, organized by the student association **Game Scholars** at Rey Juan Carlos University, with the theme **"Matter of Time."** The game achieved second place, which allowed the team to travel to **Indie Dev Day** in Barcelona to showcase the project as a prize.

### About the Project

The game is purely narrative and explores the relentless passage of time, depicting how different NPCs grow, age, and eventually die amid regrets and complaints. It emphasizes storytelling and character development within the constraints of time.

### Features
- Narrative-focused gameplay.
- Exploration of themes such as time, growth, and hapiness.
- Unique storytelling through NPC interactions.

### Technologies
- **Unity**
- **C#**
